The library is divided into several main parts, each contain related code. The compiled code in all these parts is combined into one library file for subsequent use. These parts are\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{base_library}{Base Library} \+: includes better-\/strings\+: strings in C that are better than char $\ast$, and G\+Malloc, G\+Free, a thin layer on top of standard C malloc/free. \item \hyperlink{hdf_library}{H\+D\+F5 Abstraction Library} \+: routines to abstract the H\+D\+F5 functions for use by the rest of the library. \item \hyperlink{ifile_library}{H\+D\+F5 Internal Files} \+: implementation of internal files within an H\+D\+F5 dataset. \item \hyperlink{vfs_library}{sqlite3 vfs} \+: implementation of sqlite3 database files in an ifile.\end{DoxyItemize}
